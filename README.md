## Abstract
Deep learning models have emerged as the cornerstone of
medical image segmentation, but their efficacy hinges on the
availability of extensive manually labeled datasets and their
adaptability to unforeseen categories remains a challenge.
Few-shot segmentation (FSS) offers a promising solution by
endowing models with the capacity to learn novel classes
from limited labeled examples. A leading method for FSS
is ALPNet, which compares features between the query im-
age and the few available support segmented images. A key
question about using ALPNet is how to design its features.
In this work 1 , we delve into the potential of using features
from DINOv2, which is a foundational self-supervised learn-
ing model in computer vision. Leveraging the strengths of
ALPNet and harnessing the feature extraction capabilities of
DINOv2, we present a novel approach to few-shot segmen-
tation that not only enhances performance but also paves the
way for more robust and adaptable medical image analysis.

## How To Run
### 1. Data preprocessing
Please see the notebook data/data_processing.ipynb for instructions.
For convenience i've compiled the data processing instruction  from the instructions form the https://github.com/cheng-01037/Self-supervised-Fewshot-Medical-Image-Segmentation to a single notebook. 
The ct dataset is available here: https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn3553734

The MRI dataset is availabel here: https://chaos.grand-challenge.org

run `./data/CHAOST2/dcm_img_to_nii.sh` to convert dicom images to nifti files.

### 2. Training and Validation
```
./main.sh [MODE] [MODALITY] [LABEL_SET]
```
MODE - validation or training \
MODALITY - ct or mri \
LABEL_SET - 0 (kidneys), 1 (liver spleen)

for example:
```
./main.sh training mri 1
```
Please refer to `main.sh` for further configurations.
