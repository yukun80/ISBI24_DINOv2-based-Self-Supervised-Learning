## Project Overview

This project implements a few-shot **remote-sensing disaster segmentation** model based on DINOv2 and ALPNet. The pipeline meta-trains on land-cover categories from the Exp_Disaster_Few-Shot dataset and evaluates 5-shot transfer on disaster targets. DINOv2 serves as the sole backbone, and a prototype-based head performs segmentation. The codebase is written in Python, uses PyTorch for deep learning, and Sacred for experiment management.

## Building and Running

### 1. Dataset Layout

-   Place the dataset at `../_datasets/Exp_Disaster_Few-Shot/` relative to the repo.
-   `trainset/` contains GeoTIFF images/labels with IDs {0..8} (0 = background).
-   `valset/` contains GeoTIFF images/labels with IDs {0,20} (20 = disaster foreground).
-   Raster files are read via `rasterio`; no further preprocessing is required.

### 2. Training and Validation

The project can be run using the `main.sh` script.

**Usage:**

```bash
./main.sh [MODE]
```

-   `MODE`: `training` or `validation`

**Example:**

```bash
./main.sh training
```

The script forwards parameters to `training.py` or `validation.py`. Detailed configuration lives in `config_ssl_upload.py` and can be overridden through Sacred command-line arguments (e.g., `task.n_shots=3`).

## Development Conventions

### Code Style

The code follows the PEP 8 style guide.

### Testing

The project does not have a dedicated testing framework. The validation script (`validation.py`) is used to evaluate the model's performance.

### Contribution Guidelines

There are no explicit contribution guidelines.
